# 🚀 42 Lausanne Course - My Coding Playground 🚀

Hey there, fellow code voyager! This GitHub repo is where all my 42 course projects kick it. It's my virtual coding workspace - feel free to take a peek, but here's the tip: tackle these challenges on your own first before checking out my solutions, you know?

## Layout
- `libs/` : The HQ for my personal libraries, including the legendary libft. Always polished, always on point. 💎
- `cursus/` : Individual projects like `libft/`, `get_next_line/`, etc., maintained in their original state as submitted to the Vogsphere. 📦
- PDFs: Each project comes with its explanatory PDF to provide you with all the necessary information.

## Cloning the Repository
Wanna grab all these projects together? Just hit this command and you're golden:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodule git@github.com:RPDJF/42-Repos.git
```
This command brings in all the sub-projects. Git sub-modules are like the Avengers of version control - check 'em out! 🧑‍💻 (refer to how Git sub-modules work; it might be helpful!)

## Updating the Repository
Since there is sub-modules, you will have to add a parameter in order to update them (once again, please refer to how Git sub-modules work; i swear they are helpful!)
```bash
git pull --recurse-submodule
```

## Quick Heads Up!
This repo is my coding HQ, but I'm sharing it with the community to help out aspiring devs. Dive into the code, and may the coding mojo be with you! 🚀👨‍💻

## Important Note!
Windows is a solid OS, and WSL2 makes it a champ for development. Give it a shot - it might just surprise you! (I mean, let's be real, Windows is out here flexin' on MacOS like it's no big deal. 😂)
